# Rocket ascent profile

In this assignment a model of the ascent for the Vega has been computed under the assumption that the trajectory is contained in a 2D plane. While under this assumption, together with the fact that a Control Law hasn't been used, unrealistic results are obtained, it should be noted that the main goal was not to achieve a precise plot of the trajectory, but to understand how a more-or-less complex system of ODEs should be solved. The trajectory accounts for stage separations, coasting phases, launch site clearance and the fairing separation. This is achieved by splitting the trajectory into sequences and integrating the equations that govern the phase using different initial conditions each time.
